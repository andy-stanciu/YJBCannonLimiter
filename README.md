# YJBCannonLimiter
## About
YJBCannonLimiter is an open-source Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.8.x servers. Its function is to programmatically limit the speed of cannons.
YJBCannonLimiter was originally a paid plugin that was made free and open-source for accessibility reasons. This decision was also made in consideration of the deprecated 1.8 Spigot API and declining demand for such a product. The plugin is not actively maintained by its creator, Andy Stanciu (alias yJb), however contributing will still remain open to the public and pull requests will be reviewed on a somewhat active basis[^1].

[^1]: Disclaimer: YJBCannonLimiter is poorly written and even more poorly designed by my standards (or any decent standards from a code style and efficiency standpoint for that matter). So, although it is functional, it is by no means optimal nor well-architected, documented, and up-to-date. The majority of the code was written in 2020-21, during which I was very much still in the process of learning.
